## Overview üöÄ
Py-Mood-Marker is a Python application designed to analyze conversational data, particularly focusing on extracting sentiments and emotions from text. It reads data from a JSON file, processes each entry to determine the sentiment and emotional content, and outputs enhanced data with these additional metadata.

## Key Features üåü
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the overall sentiment (positive or negative) of the text.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Identifies various emotions present in the text.
- **Contraction Expansion**: Expands contracted forms (e.g., "I'm" to "I am") in the text for better analysis.

## Installation üì¶
Before running the application, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- NLTK
- TextBlob
- NRCLex
- contractions

You can install these packages using pip:

```ssh
pip install nltk textblob nrclex contractions
```

## Usage üìù
1. Place your JSON data file in the same directory as the script. The data file should be named `data.json`.
2. Run the script by executing the following command

```shell
python mark_mood.py
```

The script will process the data, perform sentiment and emotion analysis, and print the enhanced data to the console.

## Data File

The input data file should be in the following format:

```json
{"role": "caller", "tZext": "in what way what do you mean ?"}
{"role": "rep", "text": "It just not telling you the truth..."}
{"role": "rep", "text": "actually told me that ..."}
{"role": "rep", "text": "probably started..."}
```

This format consists of JSON objects with two key-value pairs: "role" and "text." 
The "role" indicates the speaker's role, and the "text" contains the spoken text.

The output format, after processing, will look like this:

```json
{
  'role': 'caller',
  'text': 'is well because again it is still fresh...',
  'classification': 'pos',
  'p_pos': 72.72077804136673,
  'p_neg': 27.279221958633286,
  'polarity': 0.38727272727272727,
  'subjectivity': 0.550909090909091,
  'emotion_scores': {
    'joy': 3,
    'positive': 3
  }
}
```

In the output, the "role" and "text" remain the same, but additional metadata is added:

## Metadata Explanation üìã
- `classification`: The sentiment classification (positive or negative).
- `p_pos`: The probability of a positive sentiment (percentage).
- `p_neg`: The probability of a negative sentiment (percentage).
- `polarity`: The polarity score (-1 for negative, 1 for positive).
- `subjectivity`: The subjectivity score (0 for objective, 1 for subjective).
- `emotion_scores`: A dictionary containing emotion scores based on analysis.
